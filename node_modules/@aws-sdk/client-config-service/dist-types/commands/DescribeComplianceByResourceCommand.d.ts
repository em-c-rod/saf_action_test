/**
 * <p>Indicates whether the specified Amazon Web Services resources are compliant. If
 * 			a resource is noncompliant, this action returns the number of Config rules that the resource does not comply with.</p>
 * 		       <p>A resource is compliant if it complies with all the Config
 * 			rules that evaluate it. It is noncompliant if it does not comply
 * 			with one or more of these rules.</p>
 * 		       <p>If Config has no current evaluation results for the
 * 			resource, it returns <code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>. This result
 * 			might indicate one of the following conditions about the rules that
 * 			evaluate the resource:</p>
 * 		       <ul>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>Config has never invoked an evaluation for the
 * 					rule. To check whether it has, use the
 * 						<code>DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus</code> action
 * 					to get the <code>LastSuccessfulInvocationTime</code> and
 * 						<code>LastFailedInvocationTime</code>.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>The rule's Lambda function is failing to send
 * 					evaluation results to Config. Verify that the role that
 * 					you assigned to your configuration recorder includes the
 * 						<code>config:PutEvaluations</code> permission. If the
 * 					rule is a custom rule, verify that the Lambda execution
 * 					role includes the <code>config:PutEvaluations</code>
 * 					permission.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>The rule's Lambda function has returned
 * 						<code>NOT_APPLICABLE</code> for all evaluation results.
 * 					This can occur if the resources were deleted or removed from
 * 					the rule's scope.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *          </ul>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ConfigServiceClient, DescribeComplianceByResourceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-config-service"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ConfigServiceClient, DescribeComplianceByResourceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-config-service"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ConfigServiceClient(config);
 * const command = new DescribeComplianceByResourceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DescribeComplianceByResourceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DescribeComplianceByResourceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ConfigServiceClientResolvedConfig | config} for ConfigServiceClient's `config` shape.
